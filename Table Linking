After GRN creation:
input Outbound deliveries/matnr/quantities.  

it is updating to MSEG with MBLNR/MJAHR/MATNR/EBELN/EBELP. --> 101

How to link to mseg --> outbound devliveries.

1.  take PO/Item --> pass into EKBE with combination of BWART = 641 and MSEG~ebeln/ebelp. --> now you will get the reference no's i.e related to OUTBOUND deliveries.

2.  Pass this reference to the outbound deleveries of the input.
